    <p>
    <p> This is a carpooling app, a software platform designed to connect drivers and passengers going in the same direction or to the same destination, with the goal of reducing traffic congestion, lowering transportation costs, and promoting sustainable mobility. </p>
    <p> The application typically includes a search engine that allows users to find rides based on location, time, and other criteria, as well as a messaging system to communicate with potential carpool partners. </p>
     <p> Users can sign up for the application, create a profile, and search for carpools based on their location and destination. </p>
    <p> Users can create a profile with their personal information, including their name, contact information, and preferred carpooling times. </p>
    <p> Users can sign up and log in to the app using their email and password. </p>
    <p> Users can be of two types- Drivers or Commuters.
   Drivers have an option of choosing a 'Route' and sharing the car ride details for the riders to choose. </p>
    <p> Users can search for carpools based on their location and destination, and filter results by time and date. </p>
    <p> Car ride details include 'Route', ETA, Ride cost, Car model, Driver Rating, etc. </p>
    <p> Users can request the driver with the matched requirements of the ride relative to the route. </p>
   <p> Similarly, 'Drivers' can see relevant details of the commuters/users when they request a ride. They can then approve or reject the request
     and then lead the user to the 'Payment' process. </p>
    <p> Additional features such as real-time tracking of the vehicle, secure payment systems, ratings and reviews of drivers and passengers, and integration with public transportation schedules is possible. </p>
   <p> The app also allows users to create and join groups with other users, making it easy to organize regular carpools with the same people.</p>
